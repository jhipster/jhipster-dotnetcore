         * ```
         *      return {
         *          myCustomWritePhaseStep() {
         *              // Do all your stuff here

         *          }
         *      };
         * ```
         *
         * 3. Partially override a phase, this is when the blueprint gets the phase from JHipster and customizes it.
         * ```
         *      const phaseFromJHipster = super._writing();
         *      const myCustomPhaseSteps = {
         *          writeClientFiles() {

         *          },
