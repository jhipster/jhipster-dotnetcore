# Running local Blueprint version for development

1. Link your blueprint globally 

```bash
cd jhipster-dotnetcore
npm link
```

2. Link a development version of JHipster to your blueprint (optional: required only if you want to use a non-released JHipster version, like the master branch or your own custom fork)

You could also use Yarn for this if you prefer

```bash
cd generator-jhipster
npm link
```

3. Create a new folder for the app to be generated and link JHipster and your blueprint there

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app

npm link generator-jhipster-dotnetcore
npm link generator-jhipster (Optional: Needed only if you are using a non-released JHipster version)

jhipster -d --blueprint dotnetcore

```
