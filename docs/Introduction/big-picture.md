# Big Picture 

JHipster is a well-known platform for generating modern application in java world.
JHipster provides a blueprints system that allows to override the default behavior of the generator 

JHipster.NET is a blueprint that overrides the back-end part, originally generated in spring boot, by back-end in asp.net core. For the front-end all the common language can be used (angular, react, vue.js). 

In alpha version we also have the possibility to choose either [Blazor](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-dotnetcore/issues/165) or [Xamarin](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-dotnetcore/issues/488) for the front.

This blueprint is an official blueprint of JHipster [official-blueprints](https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/official-blueprints/)
