# Security

## JWT 

You can find the jwt configuration in `appsettings.json`

```json
"Security": {
      "Authentication": {
        "Jwt": {
          "Base64Secret": "bXktc2VjcmV0LWtleS13aGljaC1zaG91bGQtYmUtY2hhbmdlZC1pbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWFuZC1iZS1iYXNlNjQtZW5jb2RlZAo=",
          "TokenValidityInSeconds": 86400,
          "TokenValidityInSecondsForRememberMe": 2592000
        }
      }
    },
```

## OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

OAuth is a stateful security mechanism, like HTTP Session. Spring Security provides excellent OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support, and this is leveraged by JHipster. If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see [What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth)

### Keycloak

[Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) is the default OpenID Connect server configured with JHipster.

To log into your application, you'll need to have [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) up and running. The JHipster Team has created a Docker container for you that has the default users and roles. Start Keycloak using the following command.

```
docker-compose -f ./docker/keycloak.yml up
```

The security settings in `appsettings.json` are configured for this image.

```
appsettings.json:
  ...
"jhipster": {
    "Security": {
      "Authentication": {
        "OAuth2": {
          "Provider": {
            "IssuerUri": "http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster",
            "LogOutUri": "http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/logout",
            "ClientId": "web_app",
            "ClientSecret": "web_app"
          }  
```

Keycloak uses an embedded H2 database by default, so you will lose the created users if you restart your Docker container. To keep your data, please read the [Keycloak Docker documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/). One solution, with keeping the H2 database, is to do the following:

- Add a volume that will be persisted: `./keycloak-db:/opt/jboss/keycloak/standalone/data`
- Change the migration strategy from `OVERWRITE_EXISTING`, to `IGNORE_EXISTING` (in the command section)

In production, it is required by Keycloak that you use HTTPS. There are several ways to achieve this, including using a reverse proxy or load balancer that will manage HTTPS. We recommend that you read the [Keycloak HTTPS documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#setting-up-https-ssl) to learn more about this topic.

### Okta

If you'd like to use Okta instead of Keycloak, you'll need to change a few things. First, you'll need to create a free developer account at <https://developer.okta.com/signup/>. After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, that has a name like `https://dev-123456.okta.com`.

Modify `appsettings.json` to use your Okta settings. Hint: replace `{yourOktaDomain}` with your org's name (e.g., `dev-123456.okta.com`).

```
appsettings.json:
  ...
"jhipster": {
    "Security": {
      "Authentication": {
        "OAuth2": {
          "Provider": {
            "IssuerUri": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default",
            "LogOutUri": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/logout",
            "ClientId": "client_id",
            "ClientSecret": "client_secret"
          }
```

Create an OIDC App in Okta to get a `{client-id}` and `{client-secret}`. To do this, log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click the **Next** button. Give the app a name youâ€™ll remember, and specify `http://localhost:[port]/login/oauth2/code/oidc` as a Login redirect URI. Click **Done**, then edit your app to add `http://localhost:[port]` as a Logout redirect URI. Copy the client ID and secret into your `application.yml` file.

Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group (**Users** > **Groups** > **Add Group**) and add users to them. You can use the account you signed up with, or create a new user (**Users** > **Add Person**). Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, and click on the `default` server. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it `groups`, and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to `Groups` and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`. Click **Create**.
