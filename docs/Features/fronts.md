# Fronts 

## Using Blazor

### Why Blazor ? 

Blazor can run your client-side C# code directly in the browser, using WebAssembly. Because it's real .NET running on WebAssembly, you can re-use code and libraries from server-side parts of your application. (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)

### Prerequisites

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0

### Generate your application 

Call the generator

```bash
jhipster --blueprints dotnetcore
```

and choose Blazor (WebAssembly)

![front-choice](../assets/blazor-choice.png)

After that, your application is ready, and you can now use it with default user (admin admin or user user)

You can run the Backend with 

```bash
dotnet run --verbosity normal --project ./src/YourAppName/YourAppName.csproj
```

And you can run the Frontend with 

```bash
dotnet run --verbosity normal --project ./src/client/YourAppName.Client/YourAppName.Client.csproj
```

You can also use the **hotreload**

For the backend 
```bash
 dotnet watch --project ./src/YourAppName/YourAppName.csproj run --verbosity normal
 ```
 For the frontend 
```bash
 dotnet watch --project ./src/client/YourAppName.Client/YourAppName.Client.csproj run --verbosity normal
 ```

### Generate entities 

Like the others front technologies you can generate entities for blazor

With cli 
```bash
jhipster entity <entity-name>
```

or with jdl (https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/)
```bash
jhipster import-jdl my_file.jdl
```

### Tools 

As the project used SASS, to install and consume scss third parties libraries like bootstrap we use Microsoft Library Manager (aka [libman](https://github.com/aspnet/LibraryManager)) 
You can find libman configuration in same directory than client solution (./src/client/YourAppName.Client)

To minify css we use Excubo.WebCompiler (aka [webcompiler](https://github.com/excubo-ag/WebCompiler))

These two tools are installed during jhipster client generation, and you can find the execution in client csproj (./src/client/YourAppName.Client/YourAppName.Client.csproj)

### UI components 

To speed up our development we use [Blazored](https://github.com/Blazored) components like Blazored.Modal or Blazored.SessionStorage. 

We also use [Blazorise](https://github.com/stsrki/Blazorise) which has really interesting components.

### UT 

For unit test we use the awesome library [bUnit](https://github.com/egil/bUnit).

You can find client unit test in ./test/YourAppName.Client.Test

### Limitations 

For the moment, the Blazor generation has certain limitations : 

- Only support DTO you can't use application without DTO 
- No validation on entity fields (The validation is only on user management part)
- No translation 
- Only JWT security is implemented
